The dataset is taken from the National Geographic website. The National Geographic Society’s Perpetual Project has taken the challenge of examining Earth’s changing climate. 
To achieve this, society has set up a network of automated weather stations around the world to collect data on weather patterns and other environmental factors. 
One of the stations is located on the summit of Mt.Everest. 
The National Geographic Society’s Perpetual Project set up a weather station on Mt. Everest at various altitudes, collecting meteorological information from the mountain. 
Meteorological information includes temperature, pressure, windspeed and direction, precipitation, and solar radiation.

There are six different CSV files in this weather data, each corresponding to a different altitude on the mountain. 
The data is organized in the CSV files by date and contain hourly readings of various meteorological information including temperature, pressure, windspeed and direction, precipitation, and solar radiation. 
PHORTSE (3,810 m), BASE CAMP (5,315 m), CAMP 2(6,464 m), SOUTH COL (7,945 m), BALCONY (8,430 m), and BISHOP ROCK (8,810 m). 
These datasets provide valuable information on the weather conditions in the Everest region for research and analytical purposes. 
This data can be utilized for weather prediction, climate change studies, and other applications in atmospheric science. 
However, it should be noted that the dataset is limited to a specific time period and location, and thus, the findings may not be generalized to other regions or time periods.
